                    <div class="summary-text">Would require that ballot measures proposing to increase voting thresholds for future measures must themselves pass by the same increased threshold they seek to impose. Currently, a simple majority can pass a measure requiring supermajority votes for future actions, giving disproportionate power to a minority of voters. The measure aims to prevent abuse of the initiative process and protect local control by ensuring that statewide voters cannot easily override local decision-making with artificially high voting requirements.</div>

                        SCA 1 (Newman) Elections: recall of state officers. (Res. Ch. 204, 2024)

                    <div class="summary-title">Recall Process Reform</div>
                    <div class="summary-text">Would reform California's recall process by eliminating the simultaneous successor election that currently appears on recall ballots. Under the current system, voters decide both whether to recall an officer and who should replace them, allowing a replacement to be chosen by a slim plurality rather than majority support. If adopted, when a state officer is recalled, the office would be filled according to existing constitutional succession rules (such as the Lieutenant Governor becoming Governor), removing what supporters call political gamesmanship from the recall process.</div>
